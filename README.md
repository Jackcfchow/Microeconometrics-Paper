# Student project  (Nr. 3303229) : Replication of Bleakley & Chin (2010)


This GitHub repository contains a student's replication of Bleakley, Hoyt, and Chin, Aimee. 2010. Age at arrival, English proficiency, and social assimilation among US immigrants. American Economic Journal: Applied Economics, 2(1), 165-92.

 Beakley and Chin (2010) discuss the effect of English proficiency on social assimilation between immigrants in the US. They show evidential support for English proficiency causing social integrations using 2000 census data. They borrow the physiological insight that children before certain ages are quicker learners in foregin languages. The empirical strategy employed is to use the age of arrival as an instrumental variable. 
 
 In this notebook, we will replicate this study of Beakley and Chin. Apart from that, a discussion of the conceptual framework and robustness checks will be offered. Our analysis explores some conceptual and econometrics issues in the original study.

## Structure of the jupyter notebook

The main content of the notebook is as follows. 

* 1. The theoretical background research and a brief data description. 

* 2. The instrumental variable strategy employed and the specification of the estimations, visiualized by a simple casusal graph. 

* 3. Some assessment of the conceptual framework of the benchmark. (We put this part before the replication in order to make the criticism more comprehensible) 

* 4. Our replication of the results, as well as some assessments of the IV results. 

* 5. Several robustness checks and extensions based on the benchmark.
