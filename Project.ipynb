    "# 1. Introduction \n",
    "---\n",
    "Among numerous scholars, Beakley and Chin (2010) discuss the effect of English proficiency on social assimilation between immigrants in the US. While it is intuitive that immigrants with better English skills would be melt in the US society more thoroughly, competitive theories can be offered to explain the correlation between the two properties. A theory is that English skill lowers the difficulty, or, as economists put it, the cost of across group social interactions. As a result, interaction with the local increases when the immigrants have better English skills. On the other hand, it can also be argued that it is the people, who prefer the destination country’s culture and society more, self-selected into immigrating into the US. And the higher English level of this group of people is another product of their endorsement towards the US culture. So the correlation is just driven by the cultural preference as a confounding factor, rather than causation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Beakley and Chin (2010) show evidential support for the theory that English proficiency causes social integrations using 2000 census data. The empirical strategy employed is to use the age of arrival as an instrumental variable. The justification of this practice is that the age of arrival correlates with the ability to acquire a second language and at the same time, does not affect other endogenous variables. They also exploite immigrants from Anglophone countries as a control group for non-linguistic effects of age at arrival. The IV esitmation confirms the causal effect of English proficiency on social outcome. English proficiency raises the probabilities of being divorced, having a more educated, higher earning, or US-born spouse, having fewer children. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will replicate this study of Beakley and Chin. After that, a discussion of the conceptual framework and robustness checks will be offered. Our analysis explores some conceptual and econometrics issues in the original study.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is structured as follows. In the next section, we present the theoretical background that raises the authors' research interest. Following that we will give a brief data description. In Section 3, we analyze the instrumental variable strategy employed and the specification of the estimations. The main highlights of this notebook are sections 4 to 7. In Section 4, we will discuss some problems of the conceptual framework of the authors. Section 5 presents our replication of the results in the benchmark. Section 6 consists of various robustness checks adn extensions based on the benchmark. in Section 7 we sum up this paper.\n"

    "## 2.1 Theoretical Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Researchers are motivated to study the factors contributing to the social assimilation of immigrants. Previous studies, such as Gillian Stevens and Gray Swicegood (1987), Brian Duncan and Stephen J. Trejo (2007), Xin Meng and Robert G. Gregory (2005) have shown that English proficiency raises the probability of intermarriage. Duncan and Trejo (2007) particularly examine Mexican immigrants’ marital outcomes. They investigate certain characteristics of Mexican Americans. It is revealed that Mexican Americans who are married to non-Mexicans “tend to speak better English, be more educated, be more likely to work, and earn more compared to Mexican Americans married to either Mexican immigrants or US-born Mexicans”. Similar evidence to support English proficiency relationships with fertility outcomes are given by Ann Marie Sorenson et al. (1988), and Swicegood et al. (1988). Apart from marital and fertility outcomes, English proficiency also correlated with residential location outcomes, as Edward Funkhouser and Fernando A. Ramos (1993) and Maude Toussaint-Comeau and Sherrie L. W. Rhine (2004) demonstrated. The relationship between the proficiency of the dominant language in the destination country and the level of social assimilation brings significant policy implications. If knowing the mainstream language helps immigrants integrating into their new home, then policies help improving language skills can certainly enhance social harmony.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the nature of that correlation is still debatable. The “casual hypothesis” claims that language proficiency lower the effort, or in an economics terminology - the “cost” of social interaction with the local residents. Under this partial equilibrium framework, lowering the cost of social interaction implies an increase in the consumption of it. Therefore the language proficiency causes social interaction. However, this hypothesis comes across challenges. The first one is that language proficiency is correlated with other variables that will affect the social outcome. For example, how well a person masters a second language is correlated with his ability such as IQ. It is possible that an immigrant is getting a well-paid simply because of his higher ability instead of language proficiency. Secondly, even if there is a direct relationship between language proficiency and social outcome, it still remains doubtful if it is the people have assimilated into the destination country, such as by having a spouse or a job in the destination country, can improve the English proficiency during their stay in the destination country. \n"

    "## 2.2 Data Description \n",
    "\n",
    "Our data is obtained from the 2000 US Census of Population and Housing. Measures including English level, a crucial variable for our computation of the instrumental variable, are self-reported by the respondent as a categorical variable. The census was conducted on household level. We can identify each respondent’s and the cohabiting spouse’s answer. Martial outcomes in social assimilation are therefore possible to be shown.\n",
    "\n",
    "We subset the data to childhood immigrants currently aged from 25 to 55. A childhood immigrant is an immigrant who was under age 15 upon arrival in the US. A childhood immigrant typically did not choose to immigrate but just follow the parents’ decision. Under our definition, a childhood immigrant spent at least 11 years and at most 55 years in the US. The minimum and maximum age of observations ensure enough years are given to expose to the English environment, at the same time avoid selection biases due to retired and deceased immigrants. \n",
    "\n",
    "We further subset the data by their origins’ English tie. A childhood immigrant who has a non-English-speaking country of birth belongs to the treatment group. A childhood immigrant whose countries of birth have English as 1) an official language and 2) predominant language, belongs to the control group\n",

    "It is not clear whether the variables measure the *wellness of the integration*. For example, why an immigrant having a child in the destination country implies that he or she better fitted into US society? Or why an immigrant and his or her spouse are both implies a higher level of social assimilation? We do not see any clear and strong intuition indicating the linkage between the proposed measures and our target concepts. Certainly, for some measures, a significantly low level indicates a potential integration problem. But we cannot tell if there is no problem by an increase in the level. \n",

If the mean wage of K-people (when fixing other variables) is very low, then it might indicate that they on margins in the labor market. But what if the mean-wage of K-people is very high? It would also mean that they process some systematic properties that the locals do not. These properties also differentiate K-people systematically from the locals. The high mean wage does not make them more integrated into the destination society, although they are absolutely better off in terms of living standards. \n",

What does it mean if the immigrants are losing their “homeland features”? If k-people, after observing the undesirable outcome of keeping their “homeland features”, decide to abandon those. And they finally have an outcome having no difference in those outcomes than the locals. Are they really integrating in the US society in terms of the outcome? Or they are just integrating into the US on the surface, but they are not embracing the liberal spirit of the US, which more fundamental than those measure outcomes? To settle this debate, we have to go deep into a philosophical discussion of politics and culture. But that will not be our focus in this short article. We will just be cautious about the conceptual insufficiency of the result about certain outcomes.  \n"

    "One assumption for using instrumental variable is that the instrument is as good as randomly assign and have no correlation with Y through other uncontrolled variables. The authors justify the exogeneity of age at arrival by stating that for childhood immigrants \"age at arrival is not a choice variable since they did not time their own immigration, but merely come with their parents to the United State\". \n",
    "\n",
    "We remain skeptical concerning the exogeneity assumption. Maybe the children are not the ones *making the final call* on the immigrate decision. However, we can reasonably think that the parents, if being responsible, will take *the children's ability to assimilate into considerations* when they are deciding to immigrate or not. If the parents know that their children will have a very rough time living in a new country, they have a higher cost and less probability to immigrate. This is more easily found in East Asian nations (which are non-English-speaking) where the offspring's future is weighted heavily. In addition, for the potentially-non-assimilating children who have already entered secondary school and are unwilling to move with their parents, the parents can just send the children to boarding school or leave the children to relatives in the origins, if they have a lower cost to do so.  So these non-assimilating children will not be included in the sample. This is more common in Asian or Middle-East countries (which are non-English-speaking) where family-collectivism is practiced. Siblings of the parents or grandparents have a larger moral responsibility to proxy the parents' role when the parents cannot take care of the children themselves.\n",

    "### 4.3 Cultural connotations in language\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As the authors remark in the paper, controlling the effect of mastering English (language effect) cannot exclude the effect of “melting” into the US culture and institution. The authors’ solution is to incorporate immigrants from the English speaking countries as the control group, so as to control for the non-language effect. They explain their decision:\n",
    "\n",
    ">*This is because, upon arrival in the United States, immigrants originating from English-speaking countries encounter everything that immigrants from non-English-speaking countries encounter except a new language. Thus, any difference in outcome between young and old arrivers from non-English-speaking countries that is over and above the difference from English-speaking countries can plausibly be attributed to language*. (Bleakley & Chin, 2010, p.169-170).\n",
    "\n",
    "Singling out the language effect on immigrants from non-anglophone countries certainly has a significant methodological merit, as anglophone immigrants barely come across any enormous language barrier. But it seems to us doubtful whether the authors can really separate the language effect and the culture effect.  Anglophone countries do not share the 100% same culture, however close they are.to each other. It is fairly possible that a British immigrant found the US metric system, jumbo-size Coca-Cola cups, and restaurant tipping manner very confusing. There can still be an influence of culture in the estimation of the parameters for the late-comers in treatment group. \n",
    "\n",
    "We differ our understanding of the meaning of the parameters estimated from the authors’. Instead of claiming that the difference in outcome is completely attributed to language, we can defend our thesis better by arguing that we have to take into account the embedded cultural effect in language, by looking at the nature of language. As Morris (1949) pointed out, a (natural) language is composed of three parts: semantics, syntax and pragmatics; Semantics refers to “the relations of signs to the objects to which the signs are applicable” are; Syntax refers to “the formal relation of signs to one another”; Pragmatics is “the relations of signs to interpreters”. The authors’ mistake, as it appears to us, is to assume language skill level has only the syntaxial aspect. While anglophone immigrants have not many obstacles in the syntax of English in America, they might have problems in the pragmatics of American English. For example, when a British says “Ooh, isn’t it cold?”, what he is doing (with his words) is to invite the listener to a conversation , but an American will just encode it as merely a question about weather.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 2. Relationship between language, culture and pragmatics\n",
    "<img src=\"Graph/Venn diagram.jpg\" width=\"600\">\n",
    "\n",
    "As it is shown by Wittgenstein (1967), “the speaking of language is part of an activity, or of a life-form”. Language is a social practice. When language users are interacting, the culture of the linguistic community is manifested. Culture is embedded in a language, through the pragmatics of it. Culture is instantiated in the language uses and culture-free language is not usable and empty. The language community, having their own culture, decide the rule of the “language game”, by which they determine who is a good speaker and who is not. In other words, to be a good language user, one has to know the culture of that linguistic community. \n",
    "\n",
    "In our estimation, we could not separate the cultures in the pragmatics side of English in America. But a comprehensive understanding of languages implies that we do not have to so do. Rather, it accepts the cultural aspect being part of the estimator of language level. And it includes the understanding of culture when interpreting the estimation of parameters. "

    "The coefficients for “Spouse English-speaking ability”, “Spouse is US-born” and “Spouse has the same country of birth” are more direct indicators to an immigrant’s status: His or her English level moves in the same direction with the spouse English ability and the probability of the spouse being US-born, and it moves in the opposite direction with the probability of marrying someone from the same country of birth. These results imply that English level helps an immigrant to depart from the social circle of his or her countrypeople and be able to build relationships, in one most intimate form, with the US locals. Similarly, English also improves the spouse labor outcome, such as wage and employment status. It is worth noticing that for female immigrants, higher English level statistically significantly decreases the age of their spouses, while we do not observe a significant effect for male respondents.\n",
    "\n",
    "English level does not bring significant effects to fertility outcomes, except for the decrease in the number of children. It might be caused by the fact that the mean age in the treatment group (36.54) is slightly less than that in the control group (38.403). In addition, English skills bear no demonstrative improvement in ethnic enclaving or resident location outcomes. The technicality issue is that due to data privacy, the lowest level of geographic aggregation measure “public-use microdata area” (PUMA), which is an area containing at least 100,000 people. As a result, our definition for a neighborhood becomes too big, leading to the unsatisfactory theoretical ground for our estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in the authors’ analysis, the adjusted R-square of each estimation is not presented. As soon as we pay attention to the goodness-of-fit, we discover that equation (4) does a poor job in giving precise predictions. 2SLS estimations on an outcome such as “is currently married with spouse present”, “is currently divorced”, “has a child living in the same household”, “is a single parent” and “spouse worked last year” have an adjusted R-squared less than 0.04, which as a sign that there is just too much residual. The poor goodness-of-fit of the outcome with currently married (or divorced) might be consistent with our previous analysis. The effect of English on an immigrant’s decision on marriage is ambiguous, as there are reasonable theories to predict the opposite results. "

    "The test evaluate the endogeneity of English proficiency by verifying the economic and statistics significance of the coefficient for epsilon hat. If $\\hat{\\omega}$ is significant, it is implied that that endogenous regressors' effects on the estimates are significant, and an IV strategy is needed. Vice versa, if residual is not statistically significantly different from zero, so conclude that there is no endogeneity bias in the OLS estimates. Using DWH test, we discovered that with regard to quite a lot of outcomes, we have no statistical reasons to use English proficiency as the instrument. The exceptions are “Spouse English-speaking ability ordinal measure”, “Spouse years of schooling” , “Spouse age”, “Number of children living in same household”. \n",

As long as the economics reasoning is backed by a strong economics theory and intuition, we should feel confident employing the current IV. \n"

    "It is known that different states have different cultures and policies, and therefore different acceptance towards immigrants. Some states have an immigrant tradition such as Los Angeles and New York while some do not. It is possible that some locations of residence are more popular within non-English-speaking immigrants. For example, California has a lot of Asian immigrants because of the location and its immigrant heritage. Likewise, Mexican and South American immigrants are clustered in southern states such as Texas, New Mexico and Florida. States with a stronger immigrants heritage are easier for immigrants to assimilate. So the result might be biased. We therefore include a vector of dummy variables of state of residence and interaction between birthplace and state of residence into the model. "

    "From the results we know that English level does not inflict significant effects on age and economic closeness. But it affects education closeness significantly. A simple explanation can be offered: English skills have a significant effect on communications and consequently exchanges of ideas. The cost of communication decreases if one’s English level is better. As a result, immigrants will consume more intelligence closeness.\n",

    "Suppose the three kinds of closeness are among the goods in deciding the utility of marriage (other goods will be, for example, the appearance of the partner). To consume education or intelligence closeness, one has to pay for the effort of communication. An increase in English level lowers the cost for communication, so the relative price of intelligence level closeness decrease. If intelligence closeness is not a Giffen good, then more of it will be consumed. However when it comes to age closeness or economic closeness, the increase of English level has no effect on the cost of these two goods. That explains why the English skill effects on the age gap and income gap are not significant. We can also observe that the magnitude of English effect is much stronger for male than for female immigrants. The differential can probably be explained by different utility curves of marriage between females and males. \n"

    "The benchmark investigates the relationships between English proficiency and some social aspects of an immigrants in the US. The authors choose the age of arrival as the instrument to control for omitted variables bias and reverse causality problems. Although some doubts call for attention regarding endogeneity issues (section 6.1), nevertheless we still have theoretical reasons to retain the IV approach proposed by the benchmark. The IV results pass a lot of robustness checks (section 5.2 & 6.2). It is clearly demonstrated that English proficiency causes increases in certain outcomes, especially some marital and fertility outcomes (section 5.1 & 6.3). However, we have seen the conceptual pitfalls of the benchmark. \n",

    "The outcomes might not be satisfactory measurements for the level of social assimilation, despite being social outcomes. Some outcomes do not imply the degree of integration. That significantly limits the policy implications of the paper. We agree with most theses with the benchmark but differ in conceptual issues. As the aim of this replication paper is not to explore theories in immigration and population economics, we leave the project of defining good measurements for social assimilations to future researchers.
